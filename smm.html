    <div class="strat 5"><p class="stratstatement"> Funneling customers from ads to your website <img class="arrowdown" img src="svgicon/arrowdown.svg"></p></div>
    <p class="stratdescription">
      A sales funnel is a strategic framework used in digital marketing to guide potential customers through a series of stages, ultimately leading them to make a purchase. It's akin to a journey that prospects take from being aware of your brand to becoming paying customers. At the top of the funnel, you create awareness through various marketing channels like social media, ads, or content. As potential customers move down the funnel, they engage more deeply with your brand, considering your products or services. Website landing page optimization plays a crucial role in this process. A well-optimized landing page is a dedicated web page designed to convert visitors into leads or customers. By refining the layout, content, and call-to-action elements on your landing page, you can improve user experience and boost conversions, ultimately driving sales. An effective sales funnel, combined with optimized landing pages, is a recipe for success in turning curious visitors into satisfied customers.
